          Facilitating Connections Between Project Creators and Donors

        <p className="my-2 font-light text-gray-500">
          Algoralign functions as an intermediary linking nonprofit
          organizations, universities, and faith-based groups seeking
          fundraising opportunities (&quot;Project Creators&quot;) with
          individuals who wish to contribute to these Projects
          (&quot;Donors&quot;). In this document, when we use the term
          &quot;you,&quot; it pertains to all users regardless of whether they
          are a Donor, or are using the Services on behalf of an Project Creator
          or a Donor. For clarity, when we use specific terms such as
          &quot;Donor&quot; or &quot;Project Creator,&quot; they apply solely to
          the relevant user category. Algoralign does not solicit or accept
          Donations. You acknowledge that (i) Algoralign does not supervise,
          control, monitor, or direct Donations, and (ii) Algoralign explicitly

          or condition of quality, fitness for a specific purpose, and
          compliance with laws, regulations, or codes. Organizations and Donors
          are prohibited from entering into separate agreements outside of
          Algoralign related to Donations (&quot;Outside Agreements&quot;). If
          such an Outside Agreement is made, we may terminate your Algoralign
          account. You recognize that Algoralign is not party to any Outside
          Agreement and is not accountable for enforcing them.
